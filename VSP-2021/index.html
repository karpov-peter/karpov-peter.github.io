<!--  <h2>About Me</h2> -->

<p> Virtual scientific party-2021 is an informal international online scientific workshop to be held at gather.town platform on  April 9, 2021 (Friday) starting at 19:00 CEST (13:00 EDT). The idea of the meeting was inspired by a recent <a href="https://itsatcuny.org/calendar/correlated-phases-and-hydrodynamics-in-driven-systems">workshop</a> organized by Boston University and CUNY, which was a huge success from our point of view. 
Our meeting will consist of invited and contributed poster presentations covering whatever topics interesting to participants, more or less in the direction of quantum many-body problems. The poster session will be accompanied by informal discussions.</p>
  
<p> This party, by definition, is decentralized, unlike the conventional formal scientific meeting. In the post-apocalyptic virtual world created by gather.town, your avatar can move around and approach whichever poster and interact with people only in a short distance. We hope you will enjoy this game-like informal gathering in the age of endless virtual meetings. Two key features of the meeting are: (i) not very structured organization, (ii) an informal atmosphere. Please take care in advance of some drinks of your choice (beer/wine/coffee/tee). </p>
  
<p> Working languages of the meeting are English/German/Russian/Chinese/Portuguese/Italian... and the language you speak (if not already listed). </p>

<p> We ask you to register in advance
 <a href="registration.html">here</a>.
The soft deadline for the registration will be April 8, so it's better to register as soon as possible if you want to take part, especially if you'd like to present a poster. </p>
